It is the wedding day of Sanchi, the beautiful princess of Byteland. 
Her fiance Krishna is planning to gift her an awesome ruby necklace. 
Krishna has currently b -blue rubies, g -green rubies, r-red rubies and y -yellow rubies. 
He has to arrange the rubies next to each other in a straight line to make the necklace. 
But, there are a couple of rules to be followed while making this necklace:

          A blue ruby should be followed by either a blue ruby or a red ruby
          A green ruby should be followed by either a green ruby or a yellow ruby
          A red ruby should be followed by either a green ruby or a yellow ruby
          A yellow ruby should be followed by either a blue ruby or a red ruby
          If it is possible, we should always start a necklace with a blue or a red ruby

Can you tell what is the maximum possible length of the necklace that Krishna can make. The length of a necklace is the number of rubies in it.
